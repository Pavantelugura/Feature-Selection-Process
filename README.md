# Feature-Engineering and Feature-Selection-Process.
  1. In ML they are very important in selecting the right predictive model for given 
     data set.
  2. Feature-Selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when 
     developing a predictive model.
  3. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming        raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning.
